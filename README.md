# 🚀 C++ Resume Analyzer

## 📌 Overview
The **C++ Resume Analyzer** is a lightweight, high-performance tool that automates resume analysis by extracting **skills, experience, and missing skill suggestions** from a text-based resume file. This tool helps **job seekers optimize their resumes** and **recruiters quickly scan relevant details**.

## 🔥 Features
✅ Reads a text-based resume file (**resume.txt**)
✅ **Extracts technical skills** (C++, Python, AI, SQL, Web Development, etc.)
✅ **Detects experience level** using regex-based pattern recognition
✅ **Suggests missing skills** to help job seekers upskill
✅ Fast and efficient using **C++ STL & regex**

## 🎯 Why Use This?
📌 **For Job Seekers:** Optimize resumes with the right keywords and pass ATS filters
📌 **For Recruiters:** Quickly extract relevant details and save time
📌 **For Developers:** Improve resume writing and identify skill gaps

4️⃣ Uses **Regex** to detect experience patterns (e.g., "3 years of experience") 🏗️
5️⃣ Outputs the **skills found, experience, and suggested skills** 💡

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **C++** (Fast execution & optimized processing)
- **Regex** (Pattern matching for experience extraction)
- **File Handling** (Efficient resume parsing)
- **Algorithmic Matching** (Skill suggestion)
